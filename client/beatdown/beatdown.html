          <h3> Overview</h3>
          <p>Team up and battle rampaging gangs for the soul of your city in a comic-book style strategic fighter. Plan combos using the cards in your hand and the attack deck. Collect and use loot and powerful combo-closers. Fight your way through waves of enemies and eventually go toe-to-toe with one of the powerful crime-bosses that rule Piston City. (The made up city. Not the games studio. I'm not all that powerful.)</p>
