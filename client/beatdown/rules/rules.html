      <p>An enemy critically strikes if their attack's targeted area (notated at the bottom of an enemy attack card) includes a location that is exposed on the attack's target. (Current player, or player denoted by the enemy attack card).</p>
      <ul>
        <li>During the enemy attack phase, ALL areas are considered exposed for players.</li>
        <li>Since protection completely cancels an enemy attack, an enemy cannot critically attack a player who is protected at an area targeted by an attack. Instead their protection loses one durability. (see ENEMY ATTACKS)</li> 
        <li>An enemy attack that does not have a target area cannot critically strike. </li>
    </ul>
